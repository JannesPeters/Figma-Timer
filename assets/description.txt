Use text to create a timer on a Figma page.

There are two ways to start a timer:

1. Type the time you want to count down in Timer: HH:MM:SS format (e.g. Timer: 5:00), then press 'Start'.
2. Type the time you want to count down in HH:MM:SS format (e.g. 5:00). In this case you need to select the text layer before pressing 'Start'

Additionally, you can now start a couple of timers on a page (for whatever reason).
